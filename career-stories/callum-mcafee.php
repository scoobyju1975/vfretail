                <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
                <p class="break red">~*~</p>
                <p>When I was young I always aspired to be like Harry Potter – but the fact that I couldn&nbsp;t get onto Platform 9 ¾ meant that I had to give up on that dream for something a little more realistic!</p>
                <p>I&nbsp;ve always considered myself to be a real people person, and any job I&nbsp;ve ever considered doing has always reflected that. Growing up I always struggled to pin down a job I really wanted to do, I changed my mind on a daily basis - from rescuing people from burning buildings as a fireman or running therapy sessions using cards with huge ink blots on them.</p>

                <p>When it came to making university choices, English Lit was a no-brainer for me, it was the only subject that I actually looked forward to.</p>
                <p>Writing stacks of essays has definitely improved by writing skills, which are an advantage when it comes to writing content.</p>

                <p>Rory McIlroy used to golf there during big competitions and I used to wait on him long before he ever became famous. The clientele expected an exceptional level of service, and my manager always pushed us to deliver on this.</p>

                <p>This is where I really began to understand the operational aspect of how a store is run. After a few months I was supporting our store to achieve amazing audit results.</p>

                <p>Gradually I began to work my way up, taking on more responsibility as time went on. Deep down I knew it wasn&rsquo;t right for me. I missed working within the retail sector.</p>

                <h2>Senior Store Advisor</h2>
                <p>As a Senior Advisor I helped to coach and develop the other members of my team, this was my first real experience of managing people and performance. I was awarded an X grade at the end of the financial year, for what my manager considered to be exceptional performance.</p>

                <p>When we talked about progression, I had always assumed the next move would be into management, however I noticed a secondment being advertised within the Retail Training Team when I was in store. I felt with my performance and experience supporting the region with systems, I would be a suitable candidate - so I applied.</p>
                <p>In my current role I am responsible for training and developing our retail store teams. Most commonly I will be delivering classroom sessions in order to land key messages and learning. This could be anything from product knowledge, to systems processes, or even behavioural training. Essentially we give the retail estate all the information they need, we tell them what it is, what it does, and how it works – so you need to make sure you understand the training content inside and out.</p>

                <p>My store manager always pushed me, she wanted me to have the knowledge and she wanted to add more strings to my bow. I think when someone sits you down, and asks you ‘what’s next?’ after congratulating you on doing a smashing job, it motivates you – it makes you believe you can be better, and you feel empowered.</p>
                <p>When I became a trainer I had to start something new from the bottom. I had to understand the role, learn how to do it properly, and it was a lot of work. Being challenged gives you the opportunity to take it to the next level, it’s how you improve – It sounds cheesy, but it’s so true!</p>

                <h2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a firm believer that you need to be amazing at your current role, before you can make the next step.&rdquo;</h2>
                <p>Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to look at moving into a training lead role where I can manage my own training projects and develop my own team of trainers. Alternatively, I&rsquo;d like to stay within the retail sector in some sort of support role, whether that would be out in the retail field or supporting from HQ. </p>
