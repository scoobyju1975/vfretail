                <p>I&nbsp;d always wanted to be in the Police Force growing up.</p><p>At a school careers day I spoke to someone who advised me that the police usually looked for people that had good academic background (I.e. Go to College when you leave school!) and that had experience in a customer-facing environment, something like retail.</p>

                <h2>Senior Store Advisor</h2>
                <p>As a Senior Advisor I helped to coach and develop the other members of my team, this was my first real experience of managing people and performance. I was awarded an X grade at the end of the financial year, for what my manager considered to be exceptional performance.</p>

                <p>When we talked about progression, I had always assumed the next move would be into management, however I noticed a secondment being advertised within the Retail Training Team when I was in store. I felt with my performance and experience supporting the region with systems, I would be a suitable candidate - so I applied.</p>
                <p>In my current role I am responsible for training and developing our retail store teams. Most commonly I will be delivering classroom sessions in order to land key messages and learning. This could be anything from product knowledge, to systems processes, or even behavioural training. Essentially we give the retail estate all the information they need, we tell them what it is, what it does, and how it works – so you need to make sure you understand the training content inside and out.</p>

                <p>My store manager always pushed me, she wanted me to have the knowledge and she wanted to add more strings to my bow. I think when someone sits you down, and asks you ‘what’s next?’ after congratulating you on doing a smashing job, it motivates you – it makes you believe you can be better, and you feel empowered.</p>
                <p>When I became a trainer I had to start something new from the bottom. I had to understand the role, learn how to do it properly, and it was a lot of work. Being challenged gives you the opportunity to take it to the next level, it’s how you improve – It sounds cheesy, but it’s so true!</p>

                <h2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a firm believer that you need to be amazing at your current role, before you can make the next step.&rdquo;</h2>
                <p>Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to look at moving into a training lead role where I can manage my own training projects and develop my own team of trainers. Alternatively, I&rsquo;d like to stay within the retail sector in some sort of support role, whether that would be out in the retail field or supporting from HQ. </p>
